# AI-Based Service Blackout Detector  
A transparency-focused solution to monitor and detect suspicious outages in government digital services.  

## Problem Statement  
Citizens depend on government portals for critical services such as land records, healthcare schemes, and tax filings. Yet, they often face repeated *“server down”* or *“try later”* errors at crucial times. While some outages are genuine, others raise suspicion of misuse to delay or deny access. This erodes public trust and excludes vulnerable communities.  

## Our Solution  
We propose an **AI-based Service Blackout Detector** that:  
- Monitors government portals in real time  
- Differentiates genuine failures (overload/maintenance) from suspicious outages  
- Provides a **citizen-facing dashboard** with transparent outage reports  
- Stores logs in a **tamper-proof system** for accountability  
- Restores trust in **digital governance** through transparency  

## Technical Architecture  
1. **Monitoring Layer** → Tracks uptime, errors, and response time  
2. **Processing Layer** → Cleans and preprocesses outage data  
3. **AI/ML Layer** → Detects patterns, flags suspicious vs real failures  
4. **Storage Layer** → Immutable outage records (Azure storage/blockchain)  
5. **User Layer** → Dashboard for citizens & authorities  


## How Microsoft Azure is Used  
- **Azure Monitor** – Tracks downtime and performance  
- **Azure Machine Learning** – Analyzes patterns, flags anomalies  
- **Azure SQL / Cosmos DB** – Stores outage data securely  
- **Immutable Storage / Blockchain** – Keeps records tamper-proof  
- **Power BI** – Provides real-time dashboard for citizens  
- **Azure AD** – Manages secure access  

## Key Benefits  
- Builds **trust** in digital governance  
- Ensures **fair access** to services for all citizens  
- Provides **transparency** and accountability in govt digital portals
